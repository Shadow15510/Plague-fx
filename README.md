# Plague

## General

### Presentation

Plague inc is a strategy game where the goal is to reduce humanity to nothing... Simple? No! You will have to handle a virus with dexterity and caution to annihilate humans who are not super collaborative... Worse, these little jokers want to save their skins and are actively looking for a cure for this mysterious unknown virus!

You start the game in Central Asia.

## Controls

Launch the game, and press any key to pass the main screen. Once on the screen representing the Earth, several choices are available to you:

[OPTN] allows you to show/hide the bar below the world that shows you your DNA points and the human search bar.
[VARS] allows you to get to the heart of the game: mutations. This menu displays your DNA points, but also the selected mutations as well as your points of contagion, severity, and lethality. In this menu, you can edit all this.
[x^2] provides access to the statistics menu that shows you the stats on humans. The bar symbolizes the percentage of the total population: so the sum of all the bars must give a single whole bar.
[â†’] enables (or disables) Fast Mode. This mode allows you to advance 10 times faster in the game.
In the menus move with the arrow keys, validate with [SHIFT] and cancel with [ALPHA]. To exit pop-up messages, press [ALPHA].

To exit the game, go to the world map and press [EXIT].

In the mutation selection menus, press [OPTN] for a short description of the selected mutation. Then press [ALPHA] to return to the master data.

In the main screen of the game, the little extra at the top left tells you that the quick mode is activated.

## Mutations

In this game, you will have the choice between several mutations to do as much damage as possible among humans! As in the original game, these are divided into 3 categories: Symptoms, Abilities, and Transmissions.

All mutations have several specificities:

Spread that determines the proportion of people infected
Severity affects research, it can be understood in the following way: if the severity is high, the disease is serious, it therefore leads to active research on the part of Humans. Severity also allows you to earn DNA points faster.
Lethality determines the mortality rate among the infected... High lethality will make your disease a real killing machine, but it exposes you and accelerates the search!
the cost in DNA points.
In the mutation menu you have the statistics of the selected mutation. And in parentheses you have the actual changes. The number in parentheses therefore tells you the number of contagion points, severity, lethality, you will win (or lose if the number is negative) if you mutate your disease.


### Symptoms of the disease

As the name suggests, your disease, as powerful as it is, is not invisible: it has certain symptoms that are identifiable. Of course, the symptoms presented in this game are part of the original game and their symptoms are closely matched to it.

### Special abilities

By mutating, your disease can acquire abilities. These abilities allow your virus to better understand an environment or a situation, so the Cold Resistance ability gives extra resilience to your virus in cold countries. This translates into an increase in infectivity in these regions of the world...

### Means of transmission

Your disease will have plenty of time to change its means of transmission! This will allow your disease to futher evolve which will allow it to take over the world!
